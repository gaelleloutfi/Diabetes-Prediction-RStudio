# Diabetes-Prediction-RStudio
We developed different machine learning models that can identify, individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on a dataset "diabetes_subset.csv" of various features: Gender, Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Smoking History, BMI, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) Level, and Blood Glucose Level. It is to note that the dataset contains 1000 records.
